## I am...

- A researcher working on Computational Linguistics.
- A daydreamer loving music and climbing.

## Research interests

- Computational Linguistics
- Spoken Language Processing
- Language Acquisition

My research interest lies in how humans acquire/process natural languages.

Currently I pay attention to **speech signals** because they are more primitive sources than texts when acquiring/processing languages.
I'm aware of the problem in the current NLP trend which are biased to text-based.
I hope to make contributions that shift this paradigm into "speech-first" NLP.

My previous works on **mutilingual syntax-aware language modeling** also suite my interest.
I believe the language universality and variation are key to unravel the mystery of human language processing.
That's why I'm curious about multilinguality and syntax as well.
